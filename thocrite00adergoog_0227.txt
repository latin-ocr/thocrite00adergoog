by creatiug another channel open to all, by which professicual
rank and honour might be attained. While the profession.
wasto be thus thrown open, and purged from what are tenned
its ‘⁴ corruptious,” it was also tc be protected, by means cf
stringent prohibitione against unqualified practiticuers, enforced
by heavy penalties.

These latter measures were chiefly levelled against the Drug-
gists3 aud were designed‚ among other objects, tc settle the
knotty question respecting ‘⁴ counter practice,” which has been a
subject of dispute from tha tirne cf the Apothecaries cf the
sixteeuth century tc the present day. lt was not supposed that
tho Druggists could make any effectual resistance cn the occa-
eicn, as it was considered proverbial that they were a disunited
body—that they had no representative gerenonem, or means cf
concentrating their influence. On the cther hand, Mr. Hawcs
and his party, were baclsed bya large and influential association,
the ramifications cf which extended throughout the empire, and
which had the means of creating a sensatico by directing the
power of the members into one channel, when a simultaneous
affort was found desirable.. Α notion prevailed to a considerable
extent in the profession, that the iuterests of the two parties
were ut variance, that in order tc elevate and protect the Medical
Praetitioner, it was necessary to subdue and restrain the Drug-
gist. This prejudice had been 'hunded down during nearly two
centurias, and the jealousy which existed, on both sides, had
been aborto any mutual accommodatiou or dispessionate argu·
urent between the twc parties. The medical journals, and even
the daily papers, were constantly advocating some effectual
legislative mensures, and quoting cases illustrative cf the igno·
rauce and misdeeds of the Druggists. Although these arguments
were frequently one-siden, and the cases highly coloured, they
were seldcrn‘ answered, except, perchance, iu an occasional
anonymous letter, the pungency cf· which was taken out during
ite passage through the press.

Pharmacy stood iu aprecarious position. lts real represen-
tatives-thcse on whom had devolved tha chief responsibility of
preparing and cornpounding medicines, were calumniated ou
every hand, and threatened with extraneous control, and a
variety of restrictione. Even their right to dispensa prescriptions
was called in question ⁸, aud they held their other privileges cu
au uncertain tenure. Yet they possessed no means of defeuce
or representation, and although they were all sensible of the
disadvantages of their anomalcus position, ncne felt called upon
tc act fot the general welfare.
