The'next event which we have to notice in the aunnls ol
Pharmacy,is the Parliementary iuquiry‚inetituted byaOommittee
of the House ol commone, in 18³9, of which lllr. Warburton war
ehairman. The ob'ect of this Committee was to revise all the lawa
'relating to the Medieal Profession--to obtain authentin and satia·
factory evidence in every department ci the subject-arrd to re·
form any abuses which might be found to exist. Every person
who was supposed to be likely to possess informaticn of any im·
portance was examined, and the mass ol evidence thus collected
was, as might have been expected, very voluminoun. The lire
which took place at the House ol Commune was an obstacle to
the completion of the work, as a portion of the evidence, includ-
ing that which related to Pharmacy, was burnt when on the ere oi
publication. Sufficiant materiale, however, were collected and
preserved to enable Mr. Warburton‚*assisted by Mr. Wakley aad
Mr. Hawes, to prepare a bill, entitled “ A Bill for the Registra-
tion of Medical Praetitioners, and for establishing a Collega oi
Medicine, and lor enabling the Fellows of that College to prae·
tise Medicine in all or any ol its bracchas, and hold an Medical
Appointments whatsoever, in any part whatsoever ol tie United
Kingdom.'' This bill contained no provisiou lor tbe prosecutioni
or punishment ol unqualified mentitionem, but it provided for
the registration of those who had passed the requisita examina-
tions, and who were to pay aa annual tax towards the expensas
ol the establishment, in return for which they were to enjoy the
privileges of registration, aud holding offices of emolument in
the profession. According to the principles advocated by Mr.
Warburton‚ the public were to be lurnished with qualibed pran-
titioners in every department, aad ample means provided for

persons who presumed to practice without aqualificatioa, it being
considered that tbc public are responsible for the results oi
