³* ‘Phe Association continued to meet periodically for soma years,
their chief attention being directed to tlre suppressiones irre·
gulas aad uuqualihed praecisiones, but their efforts were not
seconded by the Medicnl bodies, and although the Association
embprised upwards of 3,000 members, their labours in this par-
tioular ended where they began.

⁴ 'l'be formation of so large an association of Apotheoaries,
distinct from the chartered Society of Apotheoaries, especially as
many of the members belonged to both bodies, isan anomaly the
object of which it is not easy to comprehend; it appears that this
Aseociation was, in lact, a revival of that which was formed in the
year 1794, and which was also unconnected with the three con·
sutored medical bodies3 but as its attention was directed to anew
object, hemely, that of ensuring the oornpetence of Medical and
Pharmaceutieal practitioners ol all ranke, and establishing a fair
system of remuneration, the result ought to have been more sue·
eesstolrhan itwas. But thewantof urrityin the profession itself3aud
the partyspirit which prevailedthroughoutthecontroversy,diverted
the influence into so many channels theta partial failure was the
[natural consequence. TheChemists and Druggists,on the contrary,
who had already acquired a standing as dispensers of medicine,
,by uniting their stren th on the occasion, secured to themselves
'acontinuanee of all dieis former privileges, although they did
not at that time aspire to the scientihc improvement which they
sira've now undertakes to bring about. Their ,Committee re-
,tained the powers which had been confided in them, aud kept
*a watehful eye on any proceedings or events which appeared
‘liltely to induence the wclfare of their body, or in which their
,eredit as Pharmaceutists was concerued. ln the year 1819 they
..settled a public mering, of which the following is the reporta
