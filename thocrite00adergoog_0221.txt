topioal or general, according to the circumstances of the case.
The syrnptorns of a crisis are severe hoils and eruptione in all
ports of the body, which, although troublesome at the tIme, are
said to be indicative of approachiug convalescence. This system
is practised by persons who are not medicamen, and who, in
fact, have little or no protensione to medical knowledge, but who
nevertheless, undertake the treatment of any patients who may
hoppen to present themselves.. Large establishments are fitted

found to be particularly profitable.

The conductor of one of these mansione was formerly a Che·
mist and Druggist, who having thrown cold water on his cre·

Several other persons have visited Graeffenberg for the purpose
of acquiring a knowledge of this new system, and following in
the wake of the inventor who has risen from the station of a

ln giving an historical account of the theories and systema
relating directly or indireotly to Pharmacy, it would be foreign
to the purpose to enter minutely into the merits of each; but
it may perhaps be allowahle to quote one other passage from
The Quarto-ly flectemus it explains in a few words the com·
parative value of remedies in general.

results of a natural process. Τὴε recovery from many intercal complaints
is the result of a natural process also. Under such circumstances, the best
evidence of the skill of the physician cr surgeon is, that he merely watches
what is going on, taking care that nothing may obstruet restoration, and
avoiding all further interferenoe. But it is his duty also to learn what
unaasivted nature can do and what she cannot do, and where her powers are
insufficient, to step in to her assistance, and act with promptuosa and deci·
sion. It is just at this point that danger anses hom saith in pretended
remedies. It they have the virtue of being in themselves irmooent, no herm
cau rcsrdt from their use where nothing is wanted or nothing can be done t
but it is quite otherwise on those occasions which call for active and
scientific treatment ; and we have good reason to say that many individuale

There is another subject, which, although not exactly connected
with Pharmacy, is as much in placeio a Pharmaceutical treatise
asin any other, inasmuch as it relatos to one of the most power-
ful “sedatium'' with which we are acquainted-the subject alluded
to is Mesmerism. This science, art, or mystery, having been
roughly handled on the continent, has talren refuge in this

country, andis cultivated by a considerable number of philoso-
