acknowledged want of all principle in the administratinrt of

medicine, its utter uncertainty, its excessive costlirress, its hazards,
and its failures;'’' and that “ Homoeopathy forms a new era in
medical seleuce, destined to dispel the darkness, errors, and nuu
certainty in which therapeutics have been hitherto enveloped3
its principle is a law of nature, unerring and immutabte-a
principle on which alone can be established the future progress
and improvement of the healing art.”†

The promulgation of this extraordinary doctrine by Dr.
llahnemann, was followed by grievous persecution on the part
of the medical profession in Germany, which had the effect of
giving him notoriety, and his cause was espoused by the Duke
of Anlralt Ob'theu. By degrees the system gained ground, not
only in Germauy, butio other nations iu Europe, and in course
of time it was imported into England, where it is extolled as
infallible by many votaries. The system has also been intro·
duced into Veterinary practice, and we are told that it is infal-
lible in curing the Distemper in Puppies.

The circumstance that every theory, however puzaling to
reason and common sense, has its supportem, is thus accounted
for by Dean Swittz-

“Let us therefore now conjecture how it comes to pass, that none oi’ these
great prescribere do ever fail providing themselves and their notione, with
anumber of implicite disciples. And I think the reason is easy to be
assigned, for thereis a peculiar Stduy in the harmony of human under·
standing, which, in several individuale is'exactly of the same tuning. This,
it you can dexterouslyscrew up to its right key, and then atrike gently
upon it ; whenever you have the good fortune to light among those of the
same pitch, they will by a secret necessary sympathy, strike exactly at the
same time. Andinthis one circumstance, lies all the skill or lnclr of the
matter, for if you chance to Jar the string among those who are either abore
or below your own height, instead of subscribing to your doctrine, they
will tie you fast, call you mad, and seed you with bread and water.‡”

But Homoeopathy, Pharmacy, and indeed the scieuce of medi·

extinction hy the discovery, on the part of Priessnitz, of Graeiien-
berg, of the virtues of cold water, which is recommended asa
panacea. ln addition tn the interrral administration of vast
quantities of this beverage, it is applied externally in a great
variety of ways. Damp sheets were formerly avoided with the
