Three dispensaries were established, one at the Physicians'

college in Warwick Lane; another in St. Martiu’s Iane, West-
minster: and a third in St. Peter’s Alley, Cornhill. They came
into operation about the beginning of February, 1697, and were
soon very generally resorted to for the preparation of Physicians'

The establishment althese institutions gave great offence to
the Apothecaries, whose feelings on the occasion are thus ex-

pressed in the words of Garth, iu his “ Dispensary” 2-

A violent contest arose, and pamphlets were published on both
sides of the question. It was asserted by the Apothecaries, that
the assistants employed at the dispensaries were unqualified-
that the druge were of bad quality, and the management in other
respecta defective. As a contrast to these abuses, the education
and usefulness of the Apothecaries were insisted on in terms lilre

the following :-
