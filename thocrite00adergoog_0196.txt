ιιιιιιιιι ιιι subject in a friendly manner, agreed to ι few reso· .
lotione aa the basis of the new society. Several other meetings
ef thia unofficial character took place, ιι ιιιι ιι which other
members were added to ιιι number, until twenty-four of the
committes were unanimous on the general princi les ef the
desociation. During these deliberatione it was found difficult to
decide what relation the society should bear to the medical pro·
lession, and whether it should be a bod entirel independent, or
iu some degree connected with the Colicge ιι ιζιγιίιιιιι or the
london University. Some of the leading members of the pro·-
fession were consulted on these points, but so great a difference
of opinion, was found toexist‚ thet the Committee abandoned the
prospect of receiving arry assistance from ιιι Ριοιιιιίοι, ιιι
ιιιιιιιίιιι to create an independent body. ,

The abstract principles of the Association having heeu maturely
considered by the Sub-committes, the subject was referred to the
General Committce on the ιιι οι April, and ιιι following reso-
lutione were unanimously carried:

“1st. Τιιι ιιι permanent laterests of chemists and Drugglrts require
that they shall immediately form themselves into a society.
