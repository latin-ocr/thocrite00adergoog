lt is uncertain at what period the Physicians gave op the prac-
tice otpreparing their own medicines; we are informed, in a work
'entitled “ Sbort Answevs to Teutanes Medicinam (1704).

'¹ ’Tis very well known there was no such thing as a company ol Apothe-
caries in the beginning ol King James the Fimt’s reign, but what druge and
medicines were theo in uae, were sold in common by the grooers; and ss
ior the preparing and eom ounding ol them, that the Physicians principally
took care ol themselves. dut this growing too servile and laborious u busi-
ness, and no other means being likely to be found out ior easing themselves
of it, bul by lopping off s considerable number oi grocers who had mostly
been brought up that way, and constitutingthem u company by themselves,
‘wholly to be employed in the business of pharmaoy, in selling ol drugs and
preparing and compounding ol medicinas, according to the Physioians¹ orders
end directions v in order to this they obtaineds charter ior them to tho
number ui a hundred and fourteeo.’'

This number coins-ides with the number ol Physiciaus who
were then in practice in London.

The Apotheceries (who had been incorporated with the

Grocers into one company in the year 1606) were separated,
and obtained the charter above mentioned in 1617. It was
enacted at the same time that no grocer should keep en
Apothecsry's shop, and that no Surgeon should sell medicinas.
The power ο1 searohing the shops ol Apotheearies within seven
miles ο1 London, and examining their druge, was also vested in
tlte chartered body.
’ Soon after the Apothecaries were lormed into a Society, they
took into their serious consideration the frauda and artilioes
practised by the Grocers and Druggists from whom they obtained
their drugs; and in order to remedy this evil, they established s
dispensary in the year 162³, lor the purpose ο1 making some ol'
the most important preparations lor theuso ol their own members.
This institution was placed under the inspection and superintend-
ence ο1 a Committee ol Apothecaries, and was conducted, in the
first instance, on a small scale, being confined to the manufac-
ture ο1 a limited number ol preparatione.

The first Pharmecopoeia was published by the College oi
Physicians in tha year 1618. This was tlte lirst step towards
reduoing the processes ο1 Pharmaoy to a regular standard sor
the gnidance ο1 dispensare ο1 medicine. It was, however, a very
imperfect production. Subsequent editions have been published
hythe college in 1621, 1632, 1639, 1660, 1677,1721,1746,
17881869, 1815, isal, and 1836.
