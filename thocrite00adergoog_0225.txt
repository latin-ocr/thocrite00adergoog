Professor of Chemistry in the University, and who acted under
the rurveillanre of a Committee of the Collega. About six
years afterwards Dr. Percival commencedaseriesof experimenta
preparatory to the productiori of anew edition: in this task he
was assistedhy Mr. Donovan, who is now well known as a Pro·
sessor in Duhlin, but after the lapse of two years, Dr. Percival
finding the undertaking onerous at his advanced period of life,
abandoned it, and was succeeded by Dr. Barker, who had come
into office as Professores Chemistry. A comnrittee was appoint·
ed 'to assint Dr. Barker‚ but tlre new edition did not appear until
tlte year 1826. Shortly afterwards, Dr. Barker published an
English translation, with notes and commentaries on the several
praeesses. This, however, only embraced tlre Chemical depart-
ment, and a second part containing the Galenical portion was
produced by Dr. Montgomery. The Dublin Pharmacopoeia is
but little if at all circulated in England, hut the praeesses are
quoted in Thomson's Dispensatory, which is familiar to most
Chemists in this country.

Dr. Christison's Dispensatory was published in the year
1842. ln this work the plan of other dispensatorias is essenss
tially deviated from. instead of its subjecta being divided into
several parts, and each topic treated of under several distinct
heads, every special topic is exhausted under a single head,
so that the observations on any one article of the Materia
Medica, constitute, as it were, a complete treatise. Thus, for
ilrstance, that portion of the work which, in the Pharmacopueia
is classified as ‘⁴ The Preparotione,'' is distributed in different
parts ol the volume, each formula being given under the article
in the Materia Medica which forms its basis. The several sub·
stances are arranged alphabetically.

Gray’s Supplement to the Pharmacopoeia has enjoyed consi.
derable reputation as a book of reference. The first edition
was published in 1818, the sixth in 1836. lt contains anotice of
almost every substance used in medicine, the preparatione of the
Pharmacopoeias, patent medicines, &c., and although each sub·
ject is treated of in general terme, and with very little detail, the
Chemist seldom has occasion to refer to the work without finding
some allusion to the article on which he desires information.

Among other works on Pharmacy may be noticed Dr. Paris’s
Pharmacologia, of which the first edition was published in 1812,Ι
and the ninth is just published. This is avery useful book,
both to the Medical Praetitioner and the Pharmaceutical Chemist:
and we need no further proof of its value than the number of
editions which have been required by the Profession.
