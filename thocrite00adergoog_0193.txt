An interview having been granted, the Sub-Committee detailed

their objections to the bill, requested that tlre 'second reading
might be deleyed for at least a mouth, and that a clause should
be inserted exempting Chemists and Druggists l'rorn the operat·
tion oi the bill. Mr. Hewes introduced his friend Mr. Gooper,
whom the Committee recognised as being the gentleman who
hed {ought the battle so ably single-handed et the public meet· ‚
ing, and who it appeared was not a legal but amedical prac-
titioner. Mr. Cooper acquiescetl in the propriety oi delay, and
Mr. liawes offered to expungo every clause in which Cheruists
were mentioned, but the insertion ol a new clause, similar tu
that in the Act oi 1815, was objected to.
' At a mceting oi the Conrmittee on February 22, the Solicitor
reported, that Mr. Hawee had withdrawn his bill, and also thet
the Colleges ol Physicians and Surgeons‚ and the Society oi
Apothecaries contemplated the introduction ol' a bill ior the

On the eth of March the general Committee ruet, and the
solicitet presented a copy ol’ a nrodihed bill Just introduced by
Mr. liawes. This bill was considered no less objectionable than ι

the reguietion oi that body, and some parts oi the bill were
