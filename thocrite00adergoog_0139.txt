ln answer to the four “ Recsons ’' abore quoted, in favour uf
*theDispensarien it is stated, that it is absurd to suppose that the
Physiciaus can maketheir medicines better than theApothecaries, ,
aiace they deuote so much less time to this pursuit3 that “ when
a Physician has got a guinea for his visit, it seldom much concerns
bh ’1100000110 conscience, hon the Apothecary shall get ashihing
for his medicines ;’' and that the assertione respecting the sophis·
¹dication 01 druge by Apothecaries, are unjust and unfounded
exaggerations. ’

'lhe plen for preventing the further increase 01 apothecarius,
consisted in the institution of a strict examinatius of apprentices
in Latin and Greek, public lectures at the hall, instruction in
practical Pharmacy, and an examination at the close of appren-
ikeesiip’ prior to the granting 01 a licence to practise as an

rt is also said, that the patients complained 01 the dearness of
medicines sold by Apothecaries; as, for instance, when au ounce
