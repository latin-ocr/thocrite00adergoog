sliat ol synonymae is affixed tc each preparation, tabler ol

aod many raluable remarks and directions are added, which
melre the work very complete and voluminous.

The alterations io the nomenclatore have been so much ccm-
nneoted upon, that it ie unnecessary tc notice them in detail.
‘Our only cause ior regnet is, that the multiplicatiori cf terms and
synonymes has occasioned considerable ambiguity, which is not
unirequently productiva ci inconvenience as well as mistakes.
Some ol the alterations in names have little cr nc reference to .
scientificeonsiderattons; as, sor instance, pilula saponis composita,
lor pilula saponis cum opio, tinctura camphorae for spiritus
camphorae, mistura acacioe ior mucilagc acaciae, syrupus l'ot
syropus simplex, &a These changes are ci no importance,
exceptio aiew instances, in which they occasion a little want
of perspicuity.

The adoption ol the imperial measure, in conformity with
the Act cf Parliament, by which measures in general are regui
lated, has giren rise to some discussion. As the Collega ol
Physiciaos is authorized by law to publish a Pharmaco oeia, and
to ensorce its obseruance by those who ccmpcund and prepare
medicioes, it may fairly be doubted whether that body comes =
within the pale ci the Act by which publicans and wine-mer·
chauts are genamad, and as the Medical Prolession has adopted,
and continues tc use “Apothecaries’ Weights,” it cannot he
denied that “Apothecariee' Mensura ’' might with equal pro·
priety be allowed. ln adverting to the disadvantage oi unne-
cessary changes ol this description, we may recor to Mr.
Philiips’s remarks cn the libro, quoted page 35, which with a
slight variation would apply to the recent change in the valua
ostheberm actorium. ln the presentinstance,‘however, it moy also

be obserred,‘that theold pint is more convenient than the new, .

as it admits οἲ subdivision to a greater extent without fractione,
and is therefore better adapted to the calculatione oi the Phar-
maceutical Chemist. Some medical men, in order to avoid th'e
ambignity which now exists respecting the octarium, use the
term libro (meaning idon.); but this is nc less ambiguous, as tlte
Apothecaries' pouud is lton. and the fluid pound is obsoleta:
Others avoid the use cs the terme pound and piat altogether,
which indeed, is the only effectual methodos arcuding confusion.
