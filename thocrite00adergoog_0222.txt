(lna recent occasion, the Medical arrd Olrim‘rgical Society
admitted tor discussion at one oi their needngs, tlte case oi a
marr whose leg irad been amputated while he tras “in a Mes*
merie trancess'* an‘d who afterwards declared that he had m

part ail'ected tras performed under similar circumstances, and
trith the same success. This was prima sacia a strong case:
but some oi the mesmerists present, as it afraid oi gaining a.
victory, launched out into tlre phenomena oi mesmerized vater,
and the faculty oi reading with various parts oi the head, witich
ieats were said to have been performed in the presenceoi rueris
Amcuarsnors. This oi corrrcc produced laughter, and wealrened
the main argument.

The anti-mesmerists on *tire otlter hand (with two or three
exceptione) seemed scarcely disposed to give the cnse iair play,
expressed regnet that it had been admitted for discussion, re-
jected the evidence ol the-patientin reference to his insensibility
to pain, and treated it as an attempt at imposition. At the
some time they cited, in illustration oi their remetire, tha esses

morbid states oi the system, forgetting that the evidence ai
this insensibility was derived from tire declaratione ond conduct
of these patients, which, in the case oi tire moratorie patient, they
would not admit as evidence at all. Thia madeat treating the
question teuded to impress the audiente more iavoarably towards ’
mesmerism thart the deiencc of the mesmerists themselves.
