Alter hia liberation Dr. Grcenlield wrote the worlr froin which the
above extract is taken, which is entitled a Τ111111011 of tlte ease,
interant use of Caurwanines 111 11ιο Proctice of Physicis.
The author describes the virtues 01 the remedy, quotes various
ancient authorities in its favour, and points out the effect 01
Camphor in moderating the irritant property 01 cantharides.
The translator, in a poem which precedes the Prelace, commenda
the doctor in these words:

“ Justly the conqueror's proud haye he clalm'd3
The small but dread (1111111111ωο0 he tam’d;
'Paught the 0001 (1011101010 vell-mixed sovereign balm
The fieroe Camasenae hot ruge to calm.”

although the internal employrnent of Cantharides, by Dr.
Greenfield, at that period, exposed him 1ο much obloquy and
persecution, the remedy is now in frequent use, and the tincture
10 ordered in the Pharmacopoeia and other works on medicine,
with directions respecting the dose and modeof administratiou.

From the facte above stated, relative to the various modes 01
practice which are allowed and sanctioned by law, the great disss
crepancy 10 the notione and practice 01 medical nien, and the dis· '
position ol the public to resist any restraint upon individual judg=
mentia the matter, it 10 obvious that the line of demarcation be·
tween the regular and irregular practitioner is by no means clearly
defined, and consequently that“ the protection 01 the public and
the profession against the 0110010 01 ignorance‚” by legislative mea-
011100, 10 extremely difficolt.

Reverting 10 the subject 01 the Prianiracorrarae, we ought to
notice that 01 the Dublin College, which is of less ancient origia
than those of london andEdinburgh. ASpecirnen Pharnace eice,
was published in 1794, and another in 1805, which were circuiret
among the Members 01 the College only, and the first Dublin
Pharmacopoeia was printed 101 general ¹eirc‘ulation iu 1807„
