ιδιο. 51. ln every eene of the adjudicetien ef· enniary penalty under
thie het, and nen-payment thereof, it shall be lnwhll fer the mngietrnte tn
commit the offender ιο any geel orbonae of correction within hin jurisdictien.

, Ceupling the definitien ef the term prectieinp medicine with
theclauses inflicting a penalty or imprisenment, for practising
without a certificate, it re clear that a Chemirt would be liable
te a penalty ef twenty peunds for recommending ten grains ef
rhnbarb, etrapping a eut finger, er explaining to a cuntomer the
,nauel mede of taking any medicine, however simple er innocueus,
and thet sumnrary imprisonment (ern ruinoue law-suit) would bc
the result ef nen-paymeut.

The constitution ef the governing body nae aleo objectionable:

A Ceuncss veen to be elected in each hingdern every three yenre, twenty
denneillert forewh. The nevernl univerrltiee and medical bedlee te need
οιοιοοι member te their reepectire Conncile, the ether membern ιο be
elected by bellet· Every medienlpractitionerto heve avete.

Hence the general precationem, the number ef whom pre-
ponderater over all et er medical bodies, would have a propor-
tionate majority ef vetes.

Ench cnuncil te elect three perenne every tire yenre te ferm ι medical
aenan. The senate te make try-lawe to regulete the educatien ef eludente
and the examlnatiene fer diploma ef qualification ιο ractiee medicine, er ιο
carry en the trade efn Chemiat and Drugglet. 'cle Councll ιο eppeint
examinem anoually.

· Cheminte and Drnggiets therefore would be under the jurie-
diction of a bed in which they were net represented, and in the
electiori of which the Apothecaries had the largest number ef

votes.

Sec. 39. All perenne, being et precem Cheminte and Dmggletr, er Αι-

Thus aChemirt and Druggist who claimed the exemption,
would lose hin rank altogether, hie name being omitted tu the
liefr and if he claimed to be re istered, be would forfeit the only
privilege to which he was entitled from having been ln bucineto
before the aeeing ef the Act.

A fen other objections of minor inportance might heve been
‘enumerated but the above constituted the chief ground of re-

nfstnnce on the part of the Chemlste.
