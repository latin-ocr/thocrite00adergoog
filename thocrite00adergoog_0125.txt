OF Tus Psounnss OF

PHARMACY IN GREAT BRITAIN.

m

Ar the period at which our history commences, Pharmacy was
in the hands os the Physicians, who proscssed the healing art in
all its branches, and prepared their medicines themselves, or
superintended the preparation of them. The science of medi-
cine was so little understood, and so imperfeetly cultivated, that
it was in general practised empirically, and was often confounded
with sorcery and witchcralt. The Greek word, Φάρμακεω, sig·-
nilies either to practise witchcrait or to use medicine, and this
acceptation of the term was acted upon in our own country as
late es the 16th century. There were, therefore, persons oi
various classes, both men and *iueiite'm who professed to cure
discsse, some by. incantations'aietherwho considered that by
their genius they were “ cut: ousae· configurated lor it ;’' and

But no lawr existed sor the⁸ protection of the ublic from
ignorant practitioners. Indead, it was difficult to discriminate
between the different degrees of ignorance which prevailed: so
much so, that it was not uncommon sor patients to he placed in

ublic thorouglrfarcs, iu the hope that some of the persons who
iiappened to pass might be ahie to recommend a remedy from
the result ol their own experiente, when afflicted with similar
symptoms. The first act ol' parliament relating to the medical
profession was passed in the year 1511, and is entitled “Aa Aur
sor tlte appointinq of Pursrcrsus arrd Sunonens.”

The preamble is worded thus:

'“Forasmuch as the sciense and cunning of ffiysick and Surgery (to the
perfect knowledge of which be requirite both great learning and ripe expe·
rieuce) is daily within this realm exercised by a great multitude of ignorant

persons, of whom the greater part have no manner of insight in the same,
notin any other kind oi learning, some also can read no letters on the
