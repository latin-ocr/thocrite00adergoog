- The a ove resolutione gave risa to every animated discussion,
and, although on minor particulata a little difference ol' opinion
was occasionally expressed, there was but one individual present
who stood up in support of the bill. This gentleman had been
deputed by Mr. Hawes to attend the meetiug, in order to explain
any clauses in the hill which might require elucidatiou. and the
able manner in which he performed tha taslr deserves to be
recorded.. ln alarge assemhly‚ in which considerable agitation
and enthusiasm prevailed, in which tha bill was denounced iu no
measurcd terma, and each sally of criticism was followed hy
applause, thir champion stood up, unmoved, and in a calm and
temperate manner, expatiated on the various clauses, for the

was calculated to raise their standing in the profession, to in·
cresse their influeuce and extend their business. Tha messing
listened with as much complaisance as cduld be expected on

legal adviser of Mr. Hawes, hut no change of sentiment was ·

the result, as the data ou which the chief arguments were founded
were hypothetical, whilst the objections against the Bill were felt

, Immediately after themeetiug, the Committee assemblecl, and
, resolved that 3000 copies of the resolutioris should be printed
and circulated, and the Report advertised. Mr. Alderman
Thomas Wood was engaged as solicitor, and J. Sidney Taylor,
Esq. was retained as counsel. A, circular was drawn u to
acoompsny the resolutione, calling upon the memberso the
trade to unite in raising subscriptione, and preparing a petition
to Parliament. This appeal was answered by a voluminosis
correspondeuce from all quarters, accompauied hy subscriptione
from many places. The Committee met on the following day,
Februar 16, at the house of Mn Pigeon‚ in Throgmorton Street,
when a letter from Mr. Ewart was read, stating that tha second
reading of the bill would not take place on the l9th. Mr.
Pound was added to the Committce, and a Sub-committes iras
iappointed to draw up a petitos, and also to walt upou Mc.
