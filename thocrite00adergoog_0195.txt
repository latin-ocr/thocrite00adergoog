cernedt in the excitament occasioned by the threatened blow‘at'
their independeoce, minor considerations were'forgctten: and*
all appeared disposed cordially to unite in promoting the general ²,
wolfero. So little intercourse had hitherto existed among the¹
members of the body, that a degree of coolness and distmst had '
been unfortunately too prevalent: and the fnilure of all former ,
attempta to form an efficient society had been, in a great mea·⁴
sure, occasioned by the division of that influence which ought to ζ
have been united and directed with energy to this one object.
But in the present crisie, jealousy seemed 1ο be forgotten, and the
necessity of union was so obvious that the first step appeared to
be accomplished. ’
The ground upon which the late attempts had been made to
interfere with Chemists and Druggists‚ had reference to their'
arrrount ο1 professioucl qualificatioo, although the arguments
brought forward against them assumed avariety of forms, and'
were in many cases unjust aud intemperate. However galling
it might be to bear the taunts and imputatione, there was no
escape while the fact was notorious that no institution existed in ¹
this country for the systematis education and examination of .
Chemists and Druggists, and whilst no proof could be advanced ⁴ .
that each individual possessed the neediul qualification. ·
It was evident that Pharmacy must be placed on amore*

was, therefore, the policy of the Drnggists to anticipare what
was about to take place, und instead of wasting their time in' '¹
fruitless controversy, to give a practical answer to all objections ²
by establishing a system of government for themselves which ,s
could admit of no reproach. > '
The prospect of attaining this object opened out unew field of ,’
interest, and some members of the Committee who had been in ·
the first instance induced reluctautly to join it, by th'e earnest
solicitations of their brethren, entered into the subject with
increased‘ spirit when the opportunity of raising the profe'ssional
character ο1 their body presented itseli. But the tesk was one
which required the most mature deliberation and unwearied per· ι
severance. The members of the Committee were not unanimous
either asto the details ot the plan orthe modeoi accoroplishing

in amalgamating the various opinions ο1 the body nt large oh so ⁴·
