passed, consulted the most eminent lawyers, and all their
ingenuity was directed to the taslr 01 demolirhing the privilege
ulrich bad been abused. Tbe words were twisted in every va»,
ricty ol form, and conflicting opinions uere given. On ononida
it was urged, that the trade or business of a Chemist was re-
stricted in that clause to “ the buying, preparing, compouuding,
dispensing, aud vending druge and medicinal compounds, uvore:
sale and retail ;'' and that the words ‘¹ recommending,” nr ‘³ pre-
scribing,'' not being introduced, the clause did not aflord pro·
lection to thern in exercising these functione. On tbe otherside,
itwas contended, that the clause empowered all Chemists and
Druggists ¹⁶ to use, exercise, and carry on the same trade or busi-
ness in such amanner as fully and amply, to all intents and pur·
puses, as the same trade or business iras used, exercised, or car·
rieden by Chemists and Druggisrs before the passing of this
Act.'' lt was well known that Chemists and Druggists vvere in
the habit of prescribing prior to 1815·; butso many years having
elapsed, it was not so easy as might at first have been imagined,
to obtain such evidence on this point as would be received in a
court ol justice. On this, therefore, hinged tlre chief difficulty
of the question, and tlre* first case which was'brought iuro court
was decided in favour 01 the Chemist and Druggistr Mr. Justice
Maule having considered that the protective clause entitled him
to give advice as well as medicine. But this decision was after· ,
wards reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench, a new trial hav·
ing been granted. ln allusion to this case the Editor of Tlve ¹

Laneet observes (Oct. 30, 1841),

“'l'he Aet of 1815 liae assumed a new form. Hitherto it has been riewed
by many ss an useloee document, ereren es en lustrument 01 mischlef· By
seward irruebam felt to be alaw of oppressius and injustior, and 1111 artes
decisione pfthsjudges against Surgeous and Physicians, while the utiqualilied
Druggist was allowed to practise witlr impunity, were regarded as offences
against common seme und justice, which few honest bearts could tolerate·
Men 01 rank and medical education were prosecuted bp the company, while
the uueducatcd pretendcr revelled iu success 1111111011.η

This then was the construction put upon the Act, which had
never been deviated from during the spa'ce of twenty-six years, at
the eud of which period the Court of Queen's Bench eet the old
words 10 a new tune. lt must be clear tn every retiacring urind
that the lawyers who framed the words, performed the task- with
consummate skill, since they obtained credit from. botbpartiesat
tlte time, and pared the way ior a rich harvest for the morabere,
of thelegal profession. The intention of the legislature svessa well
understood when the law was passed, that the words were duleus
preted by all parties in their true eud 1111111. surse, but itwee
polica in the¹ lawyers to have a double meaning in 1111110101
their own future benerit.
