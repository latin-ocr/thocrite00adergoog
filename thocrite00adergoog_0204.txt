The sum thus transferred, which had beeu accumulatiag during
the last twenty-five years, amounted to 2862 las. dd· Thia·
transfer connected the present association of Chemists and
Druggisls with that which had been for some time in a dormant
state, bot which had origrnsted from* circumstances similar to
{hasa which had led to tha formation of the Pharmaosutioal

iety.

Although the objects of the two associatione were the same,
the manner in which it was proposed to attain these objecta, was,
in some respecta, different. On the former occasion tbe proceed-
inge of the Trade were directed to a defensive resistance of
threatened encroachments, and contemplated merely the pre·
servation of accustcmed rights and privileges by legal means
and parliamentary influence. ln the establishment of tho Phar·
macentical Society a more extended view of the subject was
taken, and the more immediate source of alarm haring been suc·
cessfully combated, the extensior cf Pharmaceutical knowledge
and the further improvements in the qualifications of the Trade·
individually and collectively, became the basis of the demuto
which was set up against future innovatione or restraint.

Scon after the confirmation of the general lawe cf inermen,
attha meeting cf the members, the Council sent a copyof the:
same to the College of Physicians, with a letter requesting the
favour of a conference. It was some time before a repiy to this,-
manunirarion was received, and it was evideut frent tln's clr-
cumstance as well as from an answer received on a former occe· ·
sion, that the college was not anxious tc taire an active part irt‘
the regulations relating to Chcrnists and Drnggists. lt* was des·
sirable however, that such mensures should be adopted as world
he likely tc receive the sanction of that body, more particularly
iu reference tothe mode of conducting the examinatiore of mem-
bers aod ammiates, which was one of the most important dutiae ι
undertakes by tho society, and one in which tite experiencooh
the merebere of the medical profession might hare been a oon»
siderable advantage. . ‚ ι . ν,

On the 18th of November, 1841, adeputation cf the ehar-
